🧑🏻‍💻 Junior NLP Developer with a background in Translation (🇪🇸, 🇬🇧, 🇫🇷). Passionate about joining the best of both worlds using the latest technological advancements.

💭 What draws me the most about NLP is its investigative nature and the limitless possibilities to help, from unsupervised machine translation engines that target low-resource languages to well-curated speech assistants.

📖 Fields of interest include data, languages, machine translation, computational linguistics, machine learning and psychology.

## ⚙️ Projects
### 👩🏻‍⚕️ Thesa: A Therapy Chatbot
[Thesa](https://github.com/johnhandleyd/thesa.git) is a chatbot created to act as a therapist. It was trained using mental health data and has been fine-tuned with the [Zephyr GPTQ](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/zephyr-7B-alpha-GPTQ) model, a weight quantized version of the [Zephyr 7B Alpha](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha) model.

Conversations with Thesa prove generalisation by tackling several areas (i.e., depression, anxiety, family issues, relationship problems, sadness, stress, etc.), where Thesa is able to show empathy and suggest next steps to take.

### 🗣️ Impact of Noise in Neural Machine Translation
For my Master's [Thesis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-handley/overlay/1635518000037/single-media-viewer/?locale=en_US\&profileId=ACoAACCfeK8BjSnRsNilxfarZMOF6R5jrf37UpE), I analysed the impact that noise has in the data used to train Neural Machine Translation engines. The corpus (+1,8M segments) was retrieved from Wikipedia. BPE and tokenization were applied prior to training, which used the Transformer architecture via the [OpenNMT-py](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py) library.

The findings showed that when segments have an abnormal length or include foreign language, the translation quality significantly decreases.
