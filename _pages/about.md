🧑🏻‍💻 Junior NLP Developer with a background in Translation (🇪🇸, 🇬🇧, 🇫🇷). Passionate about joining the best of both worlds using the latest technologic advancements.

💭 What draws me the most about NLP is its investagive nature and the limitless possibilities to help, from unsupervised machine translation engines that target low-resource languages to well-curated speech assistants.

📖 Fields of interest include data, languages, machine translation, computational linguistics, machine learning and psychology.

## ⚙️ Projects
### 👩🏻‍⚕️ Thesa: A Therapy Chatbot
##### Python, HuggingFace, pandas, JSON, regex
[Thesa](https://github.com/johnhandleyd/thesa.git) is a chatbot created with the goal to act as a therapist. It was trained using mental health data and has been fine-tuned with the [Zephyr GPTQ](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/zephyr-7B-alpha-GPTQ) model, a weight quantized version of the [Zephyr 7B Alpha](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha) model.

Conversations with Thesa proves generalisation by tackling several areas (i.e., depression, anxiety, family issues, relationship problems, sadness, stress, etc.), where it's able to show empathy and suggest next steps.

### 🗣️ Impact of Noise in Neural Machine Translation
##### Python, OpenNMT, spaCy, NLTK, pandas
For my Master's [Thesis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-handley/overlay/1635518000037/single-media-viewer/?locale=en_US\&profileId=ACoAACCfeK8BjSnRsNilxfarZMOF6R5jrf37UpE), I analysed the impact that noise has in the data used to train Neural Machine Translation engines. The corpus (+1,8M segments) was retrieved from Wikipedia. BPE and tokenization were applied prior to training, which used the Transformer architecture via the OpenNMT-py library.

The findings showed that when segments have an abnormal length or include foreign language, the translation quality significantly decreases.
